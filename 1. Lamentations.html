        I am the man who has seen affliction <br>    <br>    
        &nbsp; &nbsp; under the rod of his wrath; <br> <br>
      
        he has driven and brought me <br> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; into darknesss without any light; <br> <br>
      
        surely against me he turns his hand <br>  <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; again and again the whole day long.<br> <br>
      
        my soul is bereft of peace;<br> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten what happiness is; <br> <br>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="column">
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        He has made my flesh and my skin waste away; <br> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; he has broken my bones; <br> <br>
        He was beseiged and enveloped me <br> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; with bitterness and tribuloation<br>  <br>

        he has made me dwell in darkness <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;  like the dead of long ago<br> <br>

        He has walled me about so that I cannot escape<br> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; He has made my chains heavy<br> <br>
        though I call and cry for help, <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; he shuts out my prayer<br> <br>

        He has blocked my ways with blocks of stones<br> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; He has made my paths crooked<br> <br>

    </div>


    <div class="column">
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        He is a bear lying in wait for me,<br> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;a lion in hiding<br> <br>

        He turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces;<br> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;he has made me desolate;<br> <br>

        he bent his bow and set me <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;as a target for his arrow<br> <br>

        He drove my kidneys <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;the arrows of his quiver<br> <br>

        He has filled me with bitterness; <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; he has sated me with wormwood. <br>
        <br>
        He has maede my teeth grind on gravel <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; and made me cower in ashes <br><br>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        My soul is bereft of peace <br><br>

        I have forgotten what happiness is <br><br><br>
        
        so I say, <br> <br><br><br>
        
        "My endurance has perished; <br><br>
        so has my hope <br><br> <br>
         from the <b>LORD"</b><br> <br>

    Remember my affliction and my wanderings,<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; sthe wormwood and the gall!<br> 
  
    My soul continually remembers it <br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; sand is bowed down within me <br> 
  
    But this I call to mind, <br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; sand therefore I have hope: <br> 
  
    The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases <br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; shis mercies never come to an end <br> 
    they are new every morning<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; sgreat is your faithfullness <br> 
    "The Lord is my portion," says my soul <br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp; stherefore I will hope in Him. <br>
